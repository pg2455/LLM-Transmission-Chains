Please read the following consumer report about a new running shoe brand called Lancer™.

Lancer™ is a luxury running shoe brand that comes in many shapes and sizes. Recently there has been an up-tick in the market for custom running shoes sold through in person consultation sessions. The company uses a patented customization process to analyze the way a person runs to find where their feet need support. The company then builds a unique shoe tailored to those specifications. With regular use, Lancer™ typically last for up to a year longer than other brands. However, when used for activities other than running, Lancer™’s strap design can cause sprained ankles. Also, Lancer™’s smooth sole can cause runners to slip and fall on certain surfaces. Lancer™’s special fabric may smell if not cleaned properly, and does not come in colors other than white.
